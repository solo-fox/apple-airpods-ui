        The new Apple-designed H2 chip is the force behind AirPods Pro and its
        advanced audio performance. It works in concert with a custom-built
        driver and amplifier to deliver crisp, clear high notes and deep, rich
        bass in stunning definition â€” so every sound is more vivid than ever.
